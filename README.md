# sudoku-solver

This repository was created with the intent of storing Programming Languages' (CS341)  final project. Said project consists of an application to show Haskell's advantages as a programming language by implementing several sudoku solving algorithms.

# Building Sudoku Solver

The project was initialized and has a .cabal file that contains info to build the project.

It can be built with the two widely used Haskell build tools:

- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

Either can be found with your corresponding package manager if you have a  *Linux* distribution installed. If you're using *Windows* you'll have to find the correct installer.

# Running Sudoku Solver

If you're using cabal you can simply do

```bash
cabal run
```

Otherwise on stack with the executable name generated, on this case we'll consider it as *sudoku-solver*

```bash
stack exec sudoku-solver
```
